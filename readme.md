Fabulation
==========

Fabulation is a simple tool to narrate a story in a non-linear fashion. You can write a set of 'scenes' and jump from scene to scene using links. Each scene can be decorated with audio or pictures. 

Fabulation generates a html-file that you can access via browser and publish on the internet.
